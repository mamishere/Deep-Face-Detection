<h1 align="center">Deep Face Detection</h1>

<p align="justify">
This project implements a deep learning-based face detection system, drawing on the foundational work presented in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_W4EYtsa10">Nicholas Renotte's tutorial</a>. The project extends upon this base to create a robust system for detecting faces in various visual inputs.
</p>

<h2 align="left">Project Overview</h2>

<p align="justify">
The objective of this project is to detect faces in images or video streams using state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The code leverages a pre-trained model, fine-tuned to enhance accuracy and efficiency in face detection tasks.
</p>

<h3 align="left">Key Features</h3>

<p align="justify">
<b>Model Loading and Initialization:</b> The project starts with loading a pre-trained model suitable for face detection. This model has been chosen for its accuracy and speed, ensuring reliable performance across different environments.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Image Processing Pipeline:</b> Before face detection, the images are preprocessed to meet the model's input requirements. This includes resizing, normalization, and other transformations that optimize the detection accuracy.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Face Detection:</b> The core of the project involves running the processed images through the model to detect faces. The system can handle multiple faces in a single image, accurately locating and bounding each one.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Visualization:</b> The results are visualized by drawing bounding boxes around detected faces on the original images. This helps in verifying the accuracy of the detection visually.
</p>

<p align="justify">
<b>Performance Evaluation:</b> The project includes methods for evaluating the performance of the face detection system. This involves calculating metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to quantify the accuracy of the detection.
</p>
